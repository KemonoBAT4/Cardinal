# Ideas for cardinal future updates

### Versioning
Cardinal needs to be updated and so it will be nice to have a way to store the various versions of cardinal when updating to a new one.
this needs to create a script program to prevent cardinal from completely remove all the application and data that was used before the update or the downgrade.

### Updating Cardinals basic applications
Another way to update Cardinal's functionality is to share applications that will become part of the cardinal's core applications (like an automatic graph creator)

### User interaction form
One good way to improve the whole cardinal system is to create a form where users can suggest upgrades, report bugs or problems

### Database upgrades
When switching from an older versione to a newer one, there might be problems with the databases, i would be nice if the users can set where a database column data has to be moved to the new one and then apply the changes to allt he rows and columns
