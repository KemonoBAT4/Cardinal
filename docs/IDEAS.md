# Ideas for cardinal future updates

### Versioning
Cardinal needs to be updated and so it will be nice to have a way to store the various versions of cardinal when updating to a new one.
this needs to create a script program to prevent cardinal from completely remove all the application and data that was used before the update or the downgrade.

### Updating Cardinals basic applications
Another way to update Cardinal's functionality is to share applications that will become part of the cardinal's core applications (like an automatic graph creator)

### User interaction form
One good way to improve the whole cardinal system is to create a form where users can suggest upgrades, report bugs or problems

### Database upgrades
When switching from an older versione to a newer one, there might be problems with the databases, i would be nice if the users can set where a database column data has to be moved to the new one and then apply the changes to allt he rows and columns

### User management & Structure
Create a whole server structure for managing authentication, user management, in the cardinal.py file create a handler for the cardinal's routes (a different file only for the routes is better) then create the possibility to have different applications by adding them to the list of "registered applications" to create a specific database
