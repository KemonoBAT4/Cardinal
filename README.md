# Cardinal

### What is the Cardinl System
The idea of cardinal is to create a program that can handle, learn and automate from simple to complex tasks like managing websites, bots or even
for moderation. The ultimate goal is to merge all the different projects and make them work on a single platform, removing all the problems that
might generate wrong configurations. Once the core is ultimated and perfectly functioning, to create a new application on cardinal will only require to pass the repository link of a project
and selecting the starting file, cardinal then will be able to download the project, install all dependecies and create a personalized command for the user to start the application directly from cardinal.

## Getting Started
### How to run Cardinal
<!-- In this first version of Cardinal the first way to start as development an application is the following:
- download the application with the command on a terminal "`git clone https://github.com/KemonoBAT4/Cardinal`"
- enter the folder with "`cd Cardinal`"
- create a python environment and activate it
- install all the dependencies with the command "`pip install -r requirements.txt`" -->



<!--  (- install all the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`) -->
<!--  (- run cardinal with `python run.py`) -->
<!--  (- visit the dashboard page `/cardinal/dashboard` to see the dashboard) -->

## The idea of Cardinal
Right now cardinal can create multiple tables on a single database for all the applications + the core, this will be changed so every application has its own sub-core and configuration, making calls to the main cardinal to send analytics data, informations, statuses and other, also the Users will be set in the main Cardinal and redistribuited through the application, without the need to create an account every time, the project will be executed in a small beta with a discord bot made in node js and a old webiste also made in node js and the api that will be used is the cardinal application
