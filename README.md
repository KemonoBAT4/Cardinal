# The Cardinal System

### What is the Cardinl-System
The idea of cardinal is to create a program that can handle, learn and automate from simple to complex tasks like managing websites, bots or even
for moderation. The ultimate goal is to merge all the different projects and make them work on a single platform, removing all the problems that 
might generate wrong configurations. Once the core is ultimated and perfectly functioning, to create a new application on cardinal will only require to pass the repository link of a project
and selecting the starting file, cardinal then will be able to download the project, install all dependecies and create a personalized command for the user to start the application directly from cardinal.

As you can tell [here](https://github.com/KemonoBAT4/cardinal-system/blob/dev/docs/TODO.md) there are so much work to do so there is not a release date yet.
